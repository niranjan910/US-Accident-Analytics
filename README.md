## Project Background

Road accidents are a leading cause of fatalities and economic losses worldwide, with the U.S. recording over 6 million crashes annually. Understanding accident patterns is critical for improving public safety, optimizing emergency response, and shaping infrastructure policies.

This project leverages a countrywide dataset of 1.5 million traffic accidents (2016â€“2023) to:
- Identify high-risk locations and times for accidents.
- Analyze contributing factors like weather, road conditions, and time of day.
- Predict accident severity to help authorities allocate resources efficiently.
